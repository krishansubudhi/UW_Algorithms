c)Based on the heatmaps you generated, which of the measures seems the most reasonable? Are there any pairs of newsgroups that are very similar? Would have you expected this? Explain.

e>Your plot for part (b) was symmetric, but for part (d) was asymmetric. Explain
if docA is most similar to docB that does not mean docB is also most similar to docA

example:

doc A: I am Krishan

doc B: I am going to school today.

doc C: I will be going to school today.

f) Which groups seem similar? Compare the plots from parts (b) and (d). Which method seems more suited to comparing newsgroups?
