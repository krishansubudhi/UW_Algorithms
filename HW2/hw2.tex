Office workers = $n$\\
Desks = $n$

Management assigns each worker to a random desk, without the requirement that only one person is assigned to a desk.

\begin{align*}
w_i &= \texttt{worker}_i \\
d_j &= \texttt{desk}_j \\
P(w_i, d_j) &= \frac{1}{n}
\end{align*}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item \emph{What is the expected number of people getting their original desk back?}
    let $X_i$ be a random variable such that 
    \[
        X_i = \begin{cases}
			1, & \text{person $i$ gets his/her desk back}\\
            0, & \text{otherwise}
		 \end{cases}
    \]
    \begin{align*}
        & E(\text{number of people getting their original desk back}) \\
        & = \sum_{i=1}^n E(\text{person $i$ gets his/her desk back }) \\
        & = \sum_{i=1}^n E(X_i) \\
        & = n \ast E(X_i) \\
        & = n \ast (1 \ast P(w_i, d_i) + 0) \\
        & = n \ast \frac{1}{n}\\
        & = 1
    \end{align*}
    
    \textbf{Expected number of people getting their original desk back = 1}
    
    \item \emph{What is the probability of having zero people assigned to a particular desk?}
    
    for a particular desk $d_j$,
    \begin{align*}
        & P(\text{zero people assigned to}\ d_j) \\
        & = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} w_i \text{ not assigned to}\ d_j \\
        & = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} 1- P(w_i, d_j)\\
        & = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} 1-\frac{1}{n}\\
        & = \begin{pmatrix}
                \cfrac{n-1}{n}
            \end{pmatrix}^n
    \end{align*}
    
    \item \emph{What is the probability of having exactly one person assigned to a particular desk?}
    
    for a particular desk $d_j$,
    \begin{align*}
        & P(\text{exactly one person assigned}\ d_j) \\
        & = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \text{only } w_i \text{ is assigned to}\ d_j \qquad  \text{... \textit{events for each i are mutually exclusive}} \\
        & = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} P(w_i, d_j) \prod_{k=1, k \ne j}^n (1- P(w_i, d_j))\\
        & = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \frac{1}{n} \ast 
            \begin{pmatrix}
                \cfrac{n-1}{n}
            \end{pmatrix}^{n-1}\\
        & = n 
            \ast  \frac{1}{n} 
            \ast 
            \begin{pmatrix}
                \cfrac{n-1}{n}
            \end{pmatrix}^{n-1}\\
        & = \begin{pmatrix}
                \cfrac{n-1}{n}
            \end{pmatrix}^{n-1}
    \end{align*}
